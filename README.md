### This is a simple fix to vim to fix the right-click pasting issue.

**Problem:** Right-click pasting in vim has stopped working in newer versions of vim.

**Fix:** Creates a .vimrc file in your home directory which contains: ' :set mouse= ' this **fixes the problem permanently**.

**Apply the Fix:** You can either create the file yourself or run my ./install-fix.sh which will create the file for you.
